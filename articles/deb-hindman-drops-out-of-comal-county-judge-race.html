            <p>Deb Hindman has withdrawn from the Republican primary race for Comal County Judge, significantly reshaping the contest just weeks before early voting begins on February 17. Her departure leaves Kristen Hoyt and Kayne Parrish as the remaining candidates in what has become a two-person race for the GOP nomination to fill the seat left vacant by Judge Sherman Krause's passing.</p>

<p>The withdrawal was announced during a community meeting about the controversial Broken Cedar Ranch development, where Hindman's husband informed attendees via the Nextdoor social media platform. The unexpected timing and method of the announcement surprised many political observers who had expected Hindman to remain competitive throughout the primary campaign.</p>

<p>Hindman's exit comes at a critical juncture in the election timeline, with ballot printing already completed and early voting set to begin in just days. Voters who had planned to support Hindman will now need to choose between the two remaining candidates, potentially altering the dynamics of the race significantly.</p>

<p>The two-candidate race now features Kristen Hoyt and Kayne Parrish, each bringing distinct professional backgrounds and campaign approaches to the contest. Hoyt's experience in county administration contrasts with Parrish's background in law enforcement, offering voters clear alternatives in leadership style and policy priorities.</p>

<p>With Hindman's departure, both remaining candidates may benefit from an opportunity to consolidate support among voters who were previously divided among three options. The condensed field could lead to higher voter engagement and clearer policy debates as Hoyt and Parrish work to differentiate themselves in the final weeks before Election Day.</p>

<p>The Republican primary winner will face any Democratic opposition in the November general election, with the successful candidate taking office in January 2027. The county judge position serves as both the presiding officer of Commissioners Court and chief executive of county government, making it one of the most influential roles in local politics.</p>

<p>Early voting for the primary election runs from February 17 through February 28, followed by Election Day on March 3. Comal County voters can find polling locations and additional election information through the County Elections Office website at www.co.comal.tx.us/Elections.htm.</p>
