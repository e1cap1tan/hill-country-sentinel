            <p>Comal County property owners may face higher tax bills under a proposed budget currently under review by county commissioners. The proposal includes a 3.2% increase to the property tax rate, which would be applied on top of the current rate of 30.5 cents per $100 of property valuation. This adjustment represents the second significant tax rate increase in recent years, following a 15.4% jump in 2026 from the previous no-new-revenue rate.</p>

<p>County officials justify the proposed increase by pointing to critical infrastructure needs driven by rapid population growth throughout Comal County. The additional revenue would primarily fund road improvements and emergency services expansion—two areas struggling to keep pace with the county's development. As new residents continue to move to the Hill Country region, existing infrastructure faces increasing strain, requiring substantial investment to maintain service levels.</p>

<p>For the average homeowner, the proposed 3.2% increase would translate to approximately $120 in additional annual property taxes, based on current property valuations. However, the actual impact will vary significantly depending on individual property values and any changes in assessed valuations during the upcoming tax year. Property owners in rapidly appreciating areas may see even larger increases when combined with rising appraisals.</p>

<p>The proposal comes as Comal County experiences some of the fastest population growth in Texas, with new developments stretching county resources thin. Road maintenance, emergency response times, and public safety infrastructure have all been identified as priority areas requiring immediate attention and investment. County commissioners argue that without adequate funding, service quality will inevitably decline as demand continues to outpace capacity.</p>

<p>Public input sessions are scheduled before commissioners make their final budget decision, providing residents an opportunity to voice concerns about the proposed tax increase. These hearings will allow property owners to better understand how the additional revenue will be allocated and to express their views on county spending priorities.</p>

<p>The timing of the proposal coincides with ongoing discussions about sustainable growth management and fiscal responsibility. Some residents advocate for the tax increase as necessary for maintaining quality services, while others question whether county officials are doing enough to explore alternative funding sources or operational efficiencies before turning to taxpayers.</p>

<p>As commissioners prepare for public hearings on the proposed budget, the debate over property tax rates reflects broader tensions between growth, infrastructure needs, and taxpayer burden. The final decision will significantly impact county finances and residents' pocketbooks for years to come, making community engagement in the budget process more important than ever.</p>
