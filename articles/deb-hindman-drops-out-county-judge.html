            <p>Deb Hindman has withdrawn from the Comal County Judge Republican primary, leaving Kristen Hoyt and Kayne Parrish as the two remaining candidates in the race. Hindman's husband announced the withdrawal during a community meeting focused on the controversial Broken Cedar Ranch development, catching many local political observers by surprise just days before early voting begins.</p><p>The unexpected withdrawal significantly alters the dynamics of the county judge race, eliminating one of the three candidates who had been actively campaigning throughout the winter months. Hindman's decision comes at a critical juncture, as early voting is scheduled to begin February 17, meaning her name will still appear on printed ballots even though she is no longer an active candidate.</p><p>Hindman's departure narrows the field to Hoyt and Parrish, both of whom bring distinctly different professional backgrounds to the race. The timing creates potential confusion for voters who had planned to support Hindman, as they will now need to choose between the two remaining candidates or risk casting votes for a withdrawn candidate whose name remains on the ballot.</p><p>The withdrawal was announced during a Nextdoor community meeting that was primarily focused on discussing concerns about the Broken Cedar Ranch development project. The unexpected political announcement caught attendees off guard, as the meeting had been advertised as a discussion of local development issues rather than a campaign event.</p><p>Local political analysts suggest that Hindman's withdrawal could benefit both remaining candidates, as they will now compete for the votes that would have gone to her. However, the late timing of the withdrawal may mean some voters remain unaware of the change, potentially affecting the accuracy of primary results if significant numbers of voters cast ballots for Hindman.</p><p>Both Hoyt and Parrish will now need to quickly adjust their campaign strategies to appeal to Hindman's supporters while maintaining their existing voter bases. The shortened timeline before early voting begins limits their ability to significantly alter their campaign messaging or outreach efforts.</p><p>County election officials have noted that while Hindman's name will appear on ballots, votes cast for withdrawn candidates do not count toward the final tally. Voters who had planned to support Hindman are encouraged to research the positions of the two remaining candidates before casting their ballots in the Republican primary.</p>
