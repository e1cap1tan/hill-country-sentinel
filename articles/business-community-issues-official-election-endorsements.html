            <p>The Greater New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce has officially announced its endorsements for the 2026 municipal election, throwing its support behind candidates who prioritize business-friendly policies and economic growth in Comal County. Through its political action committee (PAC), the Chamber conducted a thorough evaluation process, including candidate interviews and policy reviews, to determine which individuals best align with its vision for a thriving local economy. The endorsements signal a clear preference for leaders committed to streamlined permitting processes, infrastructure investment, and managed urban expansion.</p>

<p>Among the key issues highlighted by the Chamber, downtown revitalization and workforce development emerged as top priorities. Endorsed candidates have pledged to collaborate with local businesses to enhance the historic downtown area, making it a more attractive destination for tourists and residents alike. Additionally, these candidates have expressed support for programs aimed at training and retaining a skilled workforce, addressing a critical need for many employers in the region. "Our goal is to ensure New Braunfels remains a place where businesses can grow and succeed," said a Chamber spokesperson during the announcement.</p>

<p>This move by the Chamber reflects a broader trend of business organizations taking an increasingly active role in municipal politics across Texas. As local governments grapple with balancing growth and quality of life, groups like the Chamber are stepping in to advocate for policies that support economic development. In Comal County, where rapid population growth has strained infrastructure and public services, the business community's voice carries significant weight. The Chamber's endorsements could sway undecided voters and shape the conversation around key issues in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>For local residents and business owners, these endorsements provide insight into which candidates are likely to prioritize economic initiatives over other concerns. While some community members welcome the focus on growth, others have expressed caution about potential overdevelopment and its impact on the area's small-town charm. The Chamber's PAC emphasized that its evaluation process considered candidates' ability to balance progress with preserving the unique character of New Braunfels, though critics may question whether business interests are being prioritized over broader community needs.</p>

<p>As the 2026 municipal election approaches, the Chamber's endorsements are expected to play a significant role in shaping the race. With early voting set to begin in the coming months, candidates backed by the business community may gain a competitive edge, particularly among voters who value economic stability and job creation. The Hill Country Sentinel will continue to follow this story, providing updates on candidate responses and community reactions as the campaign season unfolds.</p>
