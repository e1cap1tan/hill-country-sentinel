            <p>The Greater New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce has officially announced its endorsements for the 2026 municipal election, throwing its support behind Robert Henderson for mayor, Sarah Collins for City Council District 5, and David Martinez for City Council District 6. The endorsements, released through the Chamber's Political Action Committee (PAC), come after a thorough evaluation process aimed at identifying candidates who align with the organization's vision for economic growth and business-friendly policies in Comal County.</p>

<p>According to a statement from the Chamber PAC, the evaluation process included in-depth interviews, reviews of candidates' policy platforms, and assessments of their commitment to fostering a thriving business environment. The endorsed candidates were selected for their stances on streamlined permitting processes, infrastructure investment, and managed urban expansion—issues that directly impact local businesses and the broader economy of New Braunfels.</p>

<p>Robert Henderson, the Chamber's pick for mayor, has made downtown revitalization a cornerstone of his campaign, promising to enhance the area's appeal for small businesses and tourism through targeted incentives and public-private partnerships. Henderson emphasized the importance of collaboration, stating, <blockquote>"A strong partnership between the city and the business community is essential to ensuring New Braunfels remains a place where entrepreneurs can succeed."</blockquote> His platform also includes expanding tax incentives for businesses that invest in the local economy.</p>

<p>In Districts 5 and 6, Sarah Collins and David Martinez earned endorsements for their focus on infrastructure improvements and workforce development. Collins has advocated for upgrading transportation networks to support commercial growth, while Martinez has prioritized programs to train and retain a skilled local workforce. Both candidates have expressed a desire to work closely with the Chamber to address the needs of employers and employees alike, reinforcing the idea that municipal government plays a critical role in economic vitality.</p>

<p>The Chamber's endorsements reflect a growing trend of business organizations taking an active role in municipal politics across Texas. As New Braunfels continues to experience rapid population growth and economic development, the business community's influence in shaping local policy has become increasingly significant. The Chamber's involvement aims to ensure that elected officials prioritize policies that sustain growth while balancing the needs of residents and businesses.</p>

<p>For Comal County voters, these endorsements may serve as a guidepost in a crowded election field, particularly for those concerned with economic issues. The Chamber's backing signals a preference for candidates who are likely to champion pro-growth policies, though it remains to be seen how other community stakeholders—such as neighborhood associations and environmental groups—will respond to the Chamber's choices.</p>

<p>As the 2026 election approaches, the Greater New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce plans to continue engaging with candidates and voters through forums and informational campaigns. The organization hopes to foster dialogue about the intersection of business and governance, ensuring that the future of New Braunfels remains prosperous for all. Residents are encouraged to stay informed about candidate platforms as early voting dates draw near.</p>
