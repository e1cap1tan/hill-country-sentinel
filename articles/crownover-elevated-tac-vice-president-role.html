        <div class="article-body">
            <p>Comal County Commissioner Jen Crownover has been named Vice President of the Texas Association of Counties (TAC), a prominent organization representing county governments across the state. This new role positions Crownover—and by extension, Comal County—at the forefront of statewide discussions on county governance, policy, and advocacy. Her appointment marks a significant milestone for the county, amplifying its voice in matters that impact local communities and resources.</p>

<p>Crownover, who represents Precinct 4 on the Comal County Commissioners Court, was elevated to the TAC leadership position during the organization’s recent annual conference. The Texas Association of Counties serves as a critical resource for county officials, offering training, legislative advocacy, and a platform for collaboration on issues ranging from infrastructure to public safety. As Vice President, Crownover will have a direct line to policy discussions and decision-making processes that shape the future of county governance across Texas.</p>

<p>“This is an opportunity to bring Comal County’s unique needs and perspectives to the statewide table,” Crownover said in a statement following her appointment. “I’m honored to serve in this capacity and to work alongside other county leaders to address the challenges and opportunities facing our communities.” Her role in TAC is expected to enhance Comal County’s influence on legislative priorities and funding allocations that affect local taxpayers and services.</p>

<p>In addition to her new position with TAC, Crownover is also running unopposed for re-election as Precinct 4 Commissioner in the upcoming November election. First elected to the Commissioners Court in 2016, she has focused on issues such as road improvements, flood mitigation, and sustainable growth in one of the county’s fastest-developing areas. Her unopposed candidacy signals strong local support for her continued leadership in Precinct 4.</p>

<p>The timing of Crownover’s TAC appointment is particularly significant as Comal County continues to experience rapid population growth and increasing demands on public infrastructure. With her elevated role, she is poised to advocate for the county’s needs in areas like transportation funding, emergency services, and environmental protections—issues that resonate deeply with Hill Country residents.</p>

<p>Local officials and community leaders have expressed optimism about the potential benefits of Crownover’s new position. “Having a Comal County representative in TAC leadership means our concerns won’t be overlooked,” said a spokesperson for the Comal County Economic Development Foundation. “This is a chance to ensure our county’s growth is supported by sound policy and adequate resources at the state level.”</p>

<p>Crownover’s dual roles as a county commissioner and TAC Vice President underscore Comal County’s growing prominence in Texas governance. As she steps into this statewide leadership position, residents can expect her to carry forward the county’s priorities while fostering collaboration with other Texas counties facing similar challenges. Her work in the coming months will likely set the tone for how Comal County navigates the intersection of local needs and state policy.</p>
