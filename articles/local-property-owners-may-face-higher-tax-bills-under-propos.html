            <p>Comal County residents may soon see a slight increase in their property tax bills as county commissioners review a proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The proposal includes a 3.2% increase in the property tax rate, raising it from the current 30.5 cents per $100 of property valuation. This comes on the heels of a significant 15.4% increase from the no-new-revenue rate in 2026, reflecting the county's ongoing efforts to keep pace with rapid growth and rising costs.</p>

<p>The additional revenue from the proposed tax hike is earmarked for critical infrastructure projects, with a focus on road improvements and the expansion of emergency services. County officials have emphasized the need for these upgrades as Comal County continues to experience substantial population growth, particularly in areas like New Braunfels and along the I-35 corridor. Aging roads and increased demand for public safety resources have strained existing budgets, prompting the push for additional funding.</p>

<p>For the average homeowner in Comal County, the proposed 3.2% increase is estimated to add approximately $120 to their annual property tax bill, based on typical home valuations in the area. While this amount may seem modest to some, county leaders acknowledge that any increase can impact residents, especially those on fixed incomes. Commissioners are encouraging public feedback to ensure the budget reflects community priorities.</p>

<p>Comal County Judge Sherman Krause stated, <blockquote>“We are committed to balancing the needs of our growing community with the financial realities faced by our residents. These funds are crucial for maintaining safe roads and ensuring our emergency services can respond effectively to a larger population.”</blockquote> Krause added that the county has explored alternative funding sources but determined that a modest tax increase is necessary to address immediate needs.</p>

<p>Public hearings on the proposed budget are scheduled over the next few weeks, providing residents an opportunity to voice their opinions before the final vote. Dates and locations for these hearings will be posted on the Comal County website and at the county courthouse in New Braunfels. Officials urge property owners to attend and share their perspectives on how the budget will affect them.</p>

<p>As one of the fastest-growing counties in Texas, Comal County faces unique challenges in managing growth while maintaining fiscal responsibility. The outcome of the budget discussions will likely set the tone for how the county addresses infrastructure demands in the coming years. Residents are encouraged to stay informed and engaged as the process unfolds.</p>
