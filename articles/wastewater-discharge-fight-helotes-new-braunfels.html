            <p>A controversial wastewater treatment facility proposal has shifted venues after failing to secure approval in Helotes, with developers now seeking permits for a 3.1 million gallon-per-day discharge operation in New Braunfels.</p>

<p>The proposed facility is connected to the Broken Cedar Ranch development site, with New Braunfels Utilities recently running newspaper advertisements to inform the public about the permit application process.</p>

<h2>Massive Daily Discharge Proposed</h2>

<p>The scale of the proposed operation has drawn significant attention from environmental advocates and residents. At 3.1 million gallons per day, the facility would represent a substantial addition to the region's wastewater infrastructure.</p>

<p>Documents related to the permit application indicate the discharge would eventually flow toward the Guadalupe River system, a critical waterway for both local ecosystems and the area's recreation-based economy.</p>

<h2>Community Opposition Building</h2>

<p>Resistance to the project is growing across multiple social media platforms. A recent Nextdoor post by resident Gwendolyn Hillis about the proposal generated 13 reactions and 12 comments, with neighbors expressing concerns about potential environmental and economic impacts.</p>

<p>The Facebook group Concerned New Braunfels Residents Group (CNBRG) has also become a focal point for opposition, with members sharing graphics titled "Stop the Broken Cedar Ranch Development" that highlight concerns about the wastewater facility.</p>

<blockquote>"Our river system is already under pressure from development and drought. Adding 3.1 million gallons per day of treated wastewater could push us past a tipping point," commented one CNBRG member.</blockquote>

<h2>Economic Impact Concerns</h2>

<p>Beyond environmental concerns, residents worry about potential impacts on the local tourism economy, which depends heavily on the Guadalupe River's reputation for clean water and recreational activities.</p>

<p>The river supports a multi-million-dollar tubing, fishing, and recreation industry that employs hundreds of local residents and draws visitors from across Texas.</p>

<h2>Regulatory Review Process</h2>

<p>The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) oversees wastewater discharge permits in the state. The public comment period for such applications typically lasts 30 days from the date of official notice.</p>

<p>New Braunfels Utilities and city officials have not yet responded to requests for comment about the permit application's current status or their position on the proposal.</p>

<p>The controversy reflects broader regional tensions as Hill Country communities balance economic development with environmental protection and quality of life concerns.</p>
