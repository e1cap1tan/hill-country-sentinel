            <p>Deb Hindman, one of three Republican candidates for Comal County Judge, has withdrawn from the race, her husband Dave Hindman announced on Nextdoor on February 11.</p><p>"Deb has dropped out of the County Judge Race. Please choose one of the other two candidates. Deb will still be on the ballot but is NOT running," Dave Hindman wrote in a post from the Broken Cedar Ranch community meeting at Canyon Lake High School.</p><p>The announcement came during a packed meeting focused on the proposed Lennar development and concerns about the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The post received 45 reactions and significant community engagement.</p><p>With Hindman's withdrawal, the County Judge Republican primary is now a two-candidate race between <strong>Kristen Hoyt</strong>, the current Tax Assessor-Collector who resigned to run for judge, and <strong>Kayne Parrish</strong>, a New Braunfels firefighter. Hindman, who operates an RV park in Canyon Lake, will remain on the March 3 ballot but is asking voters not to select her.</p><p>The timing is notable — early voting begins February 17, just days away. Voters who had planned to support Hindman will need to redirect their choice to one of the remaining candidates.</p><h2>The Remaining Candidates</h2><p><strong>Kristen Hoyt</strong> left her position as County Tax Assessor-Collector to pursue the judge seat. Commissioners appointed Stuart Hansmann to serve out her remaining term.</p><p><strong>Kayne Parrish</strong> is a New Braunfels firefighter running on a platform of public service and community involvement.</p><p>The seat opened after the passing of County Judge Sherman Krause. Commissioners are also scheduled to discuss appointing an interim judge on February 26.</p>
