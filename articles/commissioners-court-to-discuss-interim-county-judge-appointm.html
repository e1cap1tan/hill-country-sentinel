            <p>The Comal County Commissioners Court is set to convene on February 26 to discuss the appointment of an interim county judge, a critical step to ensure the continuity of county operations following the recent passing of Judge Sherman Krause. Krause, who had served as county judge since 2013, announced prior to his death that he would not seek re-election in the upcoming cycle. His unexpected passing has left the position vacant, prompting the need for a temporary appointment until a permanent successor is elected.</p>

<p>The role of county judge is pivotal in Comal County, overseeing the Commissioners Court, managing county budgets, and serving as the chief executive for emergency management. An interim appointment is essential to maintain the smooth functioning of these responsibilities during the ongoing election process. The Commissioners Court, composed of four precinct commissioners, will deliberate on potential candidates for the interim role, though no specific names have been publicly confirmed as of yet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the race for the permanent county judge position is already underway, with three Republican candidates listed on the ballot for the March primary. These candidates had filed to run before Krause's passing, as he had already declared his intention to step down at the end of his term. The primary will narrow the field, with the winner advancing to the general election in November unless no opposition emerges from other parties.</p>

<p>The timing of the interim appointment is particularly significant, as Comal County faces several pressing issues, including infrastructure development, property tax concerns, and preparations for potential spring weather emergencies. Local residents and stakeholders will be watching closely to see who is selected to steer the county through this transitional period. The interim judge will not only handle day-to-day governance but also set the tone for collaboration with the Commissioners Court during a time of change.</p>

<p>Community members are encouraged to attend the February 26 meeting at the Comal County Courthouse in New Braunfels, where public input may be considered during the discussion. Transparency in the appointment process is a priority for the Commissioners Court, as they aim to balance the immediate needs of the county with respect for the democratic process unfolding through the primaries.</p>

<p>As Comal County navigates this period of transition, the interim appointment will serve as a bridge to the future, ensuring that critical decisions are not delayed while voters prepare to choose their next county judge. The Hill Country Sentinel will continue to provide updates on the Commissioners Court's decision and the ongoing election cycle, keeping residents informed on this important local matter.</p>
