        <div class="article-body">
            <p>Mayoral candidate Michael French drew 45 residents to his first campaign Meet & Greet and Town Hall event, held at Cooper's Pit Bar-B-Que on the TX-337 Loop in New Braunfels.</p>

<p>French, who expressed excitement about the level of engagement from attendees, spent the evening fielding questions from residents about city issues and his vision for New Braunfels' future.</p>

<h2>Strong Community Engagement</h2>

<p>"I was excited about all their questions," French commented after the event, highlighting the interactive nature of the town hall format that allowed for direct dialogue between candidate and constituents.</p>

<p>The Cooper's Pit Bar-B-Que location at 1125 TX-337 Loop provided a casual, accessible venue for the community gathering, reflecting French's approach to grassroots campaigning.</p>

<h2>Crowded Mayoral Field</h2>

<p>French is one of five candidates who have filed for the New Braunfels mayoral race, joining Linnartz, Porter, Allen, and Frazier in what promises to be a competitive election.</p>

<p>With multiple candidates in the race, each is working to distinguish their platform and build name recognition among voters ahead of the May 2, 2026 general election.</p>

<h2>Election Timeline Approaches</h2>

<p>Early voting for the municipal election begins February 17, giving candidates just over a week to continue their outreach efforts before ballots become available.</p>

<p>The compressed timeline between now and early voting has intensified campaign activities across all races, with candidates scheduling multiple events per week to maximize voter contact.</p>

<h2>Social Media Amplification</h2>

<p>Word of French's town hall spread through local Facebook groups, with administrators from both the "Concerned Citizens of NB" group and the Concerned New Braunfels Residents Group (CNBRG) sharing information about the event.</p>

<p>These community-focused social media platforms have become crucial venues for political organizing and information sharing in local elections.</p>

<blockquote>"It's encouraging to see candidates taking time for real conversations with residents rather than just soundbites," wrote one Facebook commenter after the event.</blockquote>

<h2>Campaign Season Momentum</h2>

<p>The 45-person turnout represents solid early engagement for French's campaign, particularly for an evening event on a weeknight. Political observers note that attendance at early campaign events often serves as an indicator of candidate organization and voter enthusiasm.</p>

<p>All mayoral candidates are expected to ramp up their public appearances as early voting approaches, with additional forums and community events planned throughout the district.</p>
