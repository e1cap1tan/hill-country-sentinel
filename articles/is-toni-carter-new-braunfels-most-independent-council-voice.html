            <p>In the evolving landscape of New Braunfels city governance, District 3 Council Member Toni Carter has emerged as a distinct voice of opposition on the City Council. Since May 2025, Carter has cast dissenting votes in 26 recorded decisions, often standing alone on issues ranging from utility rate hikes to infrastructure projects. Her voting record has positioned her as a pivotal figure in local politics, with the ability to influence outcomes on critical city initiatives, even when in the minority.</p>

<p>One of Carter's most notable dissents came during a 6-1 vote on proposed electric rate increases by New Braunfels Utilities (NBU). As the sole council member to oppose the hike, Carter argued that the increase placed an undue burden on residents already grappling with rising costs. While the measure passed, her stance resonated with a segment of the community concerned about affordability, sparking discussions about the council's approach to utility oversight.</p>

<p>Carter's influence extends beyond symbolic opposition, particularly in zoning matters involving short-term rentals (STRs). Under Texas law, zoning changes require a supermajority vote—often five of seven council members—to pass. In three separate cases, Carter's opposition, combined with at least one other dissenting vote, blocked STR approvals that had majority support of four or five members. This strategic use of supermajority rules has frustrated some developers and council colleagues, while earning praise from residents wary of neighborhood changes due to vacation rentals.</p>

<p>Her independent streak is further evidenced by her lone vote against a $240,000 flood remapping project intended to update the city's flood risk data. Carter questioned the cost and scope of the initiative, suggesting that funds could be better allocated to immediate infrastructure needs. Similarly, she opposed fee increases for aquatic facilities at Landa Park and voted against several large-scale infrastructure spending proposals, citing fiscal conservatism and a need for greater transparency in budgeting.</p>

<p>Representing District 3, which encompasses a mix of historic neighborhoods and growing commercial areas, Carter has articulated a vision of governance that prioritizes resident input over rapid development. Her positions often reflect concerns about preserving community character and managing growth sustainably. With her term not up for re-election until after 2026, Carter faces no immediate political pressure, potentially emboldening her to maintain her contrarian approach.</p>

<p>The impact of Carter's voting record is felt across New Braunfels, where her ability to sway outcomes—especially on zoning and development—has slowed certain projects. Supporters view her as a necessary check on unchecked growth, while critics argue her opposition stalls progress on issues like flood preparedness and economic expansion. As one local business owner remarked, <blockquote>"Her vote can stop things dead in their tracks, even when most of the council agrees. It's frustrating, but it forces us to make a stronger case."</blockquote></p>

<p>As the City Council navigates a busy agenda in the coming months, including further debates on infrastructure and housing, Carter's role as a swing vote will likely remain under scrutiny. Her independence raises broader questions about the balance of power on the council and how dissent shapes policy in a growing city like New Braunfels. For now, Toni Carter continues to wield outsized influence, one vote at a time.</p>
