            <p>The Greater New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce is set to host a pre-primary candidate forum on February 15, offering Comal County voters a crucial opportunity to engage directly with candidates ahead of the upcoming primary election. Strategically scheduled just two days before early voting begins on February 17, the event aims to equip residents with firsthand insights into the platforms of those running for local and state offices. With the primary election slated for March 3, this forum is a timely platform for dialogue during a critical phase of the election season.</p>

<p>Taking place at the Chamber's headquarters in New Braunfels, the forum will spotlight candidates from several contested races on the primary ballot, including county offices and state legislative seats that directly influence Comal County. Attendees will have the chance to pose questions and hear candidates address key local concerns such as infrastructure improvements, economic development, and public safety. For many voters, this event represents a rare opportunity to interact with candidates face-to-face before making their decisions at the polls.</p>

<p>With early voting expected to see significant participation from Comal County residents, the forum's timing underscores its importance. Competitive races across both Republican and Democratic primaries have heightened interest in the primary election, and the Chamber seeks to provide clarity amid the flurry of campaign messaging. "We're committed to empowering our community with the knowledge to make informed choices," a Chamber spokesperson stated. "Local elections shape our daily lives, and we want to ensure voters have a direct line to the candidates."</p>

<p>The Greater New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce continues to play a pivotal role in fostering civic engagement within Comal County. By organizing this forum, the Chamber reinforces its dedication to transparent and informed local elections, particularly for races that impact policies on taxation, zoning, and economic growth. These issues resonate deeply with the region's business community, which views the outcomes of these contests as critical to the area's economic vitality and overall quality of life.</p>

<p>This year, local business leaders and stakeholders have shown increased involvement in the political process, reflecting the high stakes of these elections. Many Chamber members see the forum as a bridge between the business sector and future elected officials, ensuring that economic priorities remain central to candidates' agendas. As one New Braunfels business owner noted, "These elections aren't just about choosing leaders; they're about securing the future of our community and our livelihoods."</p>

<p>For Comal County residents, the February 15 forum offers a chance to move beyond partisan narratives and focus on substantive local issues. From managing rapid growth in New Braunfels to allocating county resources and improving schools, the event will illuminate how candidates plan to address the region's most pressing challenges. With early voting fast approaching, the Chamber urges all eligible voters to attend and actively participate in shaping the county's future.</p>
