            <p>The Greater New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce released its endorsement list for the 2026 municipal election, backing a slate of candidates who support business-friendly development policies and economic growth initiatives.</p>

<p>The chamber's political action committee conducted a comprehensive candidate evaluation process before announcing support for mayoral and city council candidates who demonstrated alignment with the organization's pro-growth agenda. The endorsements focus on candidates who favor streamlined permitting processes, infrastructure investment, and policies that encourage business expansion.</p>

<p>"Our endorsed candidates understand that a healthy business climate benefits everyone in our community," said chamber leadership in announcing the endorsements. "They support policies that will help New Braunfels continue to grow responsibly while maintaining the quality of life that makes our city special."</p>

<h2>Focus on Economic Development</h2>

<p>The chamber's endorsement criteria emphasized candidates' positions on key business issues including zoning flexibility, development impact fees, and transportation infrastructure improvements. With New Braunfels experiencing rapid population growth, the chamber prioritized candidates who support managed expansion that accommodates new residents and businesses while preserving community character.</p>

<p>The endorsed candidates have pledged to work with the business community on initiatives including downtown revitalization, tourism promotion, and workforce development programs. Several have specifically committed to maintaining competitive commercial property tax rates and supporting public-private partnerships for infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>The chamber's involvement in local elections reflects a broader trend of business organizations taking active roles in municipal politics to ensure economic development priorities are represented in local government decision-making. Early voting for the New Braunfels municipal election begins February 17, with election day scheduled for March 3, 2026.</p>
