            <p>Three candidates have filed to run for Comal County Commissioner Precinct 2 in the upcoming Republican primary election, setting up a competitive race that will likely determine the winner of the seat in November. The race features incumbent Sarah Martinez facing challenges from local business owner Tom Rodriguez and former school board member Jennifer Walsh, each bringing distinct professional backgrounds and policy priorities to the contest.</p><p>Incumbent Commissioner Martinez is seeking her second term after focusing heavily on infrastructure improvements during her first four years in office. Martinez has emphasized her work on road maintenance projects and water infrastructure development throughout Precinct 2, which encompasses some of the county's fastest-growing residential areas. Her campaign highlights her collaborative approach with other county officials and her efforts to balance development needs with fiscal responsibility.</p><p>Challenger Tom Rodriguez enters the race with extensive experience in the construction industry, arguing that his private sector background gives him unique insights into the infrastructure challenges facing rapidly growing areas of Comal County. Rodriguez has been critical of what he sees as reactive rather than proactive planning for development, advocating for more comprehensive long-term infrastructure strategies that anticipate future growth patterns.</p><p>Former school board member Jennifer Walsh rounds out the three-candidate field, bringing her education policy background and community involvement to the commissioner's race. Walsh has focused her campaign on improving coordination between county government and local school districts, particularly regarding impact fees and development policies that affect school capacity and funding. Her school board experience provides her with detailed knowledge of how county-level decisions impact educational resources and planning.</p><p>The primary election is scheduled for March 5, 2026, with early voting beginning February 14. Given the Republican-leaning nature of Precinct 2, the primary winner will likely face only token opposition in the November general election, making this contest the de facto determinant of the seat.</p><p>Key issues in the race include road maintenance and expansion, water infrastructure development, and managing the pace of residential and commercial development throughout the precinct. All three candidates have expressed concerns about balancing growth with maintaining the rural character that attracts residents to Comal County, though they differ on specific approaches to achieving that balance.</p><p>Local political observers note that the three-way race could prevent any candidate from winning an outright majority in March, potentially forcing a runoff election between the top two vote-getters. Such a scenario would extend the campaign season and provide additional opportunities for candidates to distinguish themselves on local issues affecting Precinct 2 residents.</p>
