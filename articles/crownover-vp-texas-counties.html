            <p>Comal County Precinct 4 Commissioner Jen Crownover was sworn in as vice president of the Texas Association of Counties Board of Directors on Friday, January 9, marking a significant leadership achievement for the local official who has represented her precinct since 2015.</p>

<p>The appointment places Crownover in a key position to advocate for county interests across the state as part of the TAC's three-member executive team. She will serve alongside Denton County Treasurer Cindy Yeatts Brown, who assumes the presidency, and McLennan County Tax Assessor-Collector Randy H. Riggs as president-elect for the 2026-2027 term.</p>

<p>"I am honored to represent Comal County and to serve as vice president of the TAC Board of Directors," Crownover said in a statement. "My fellow board members and I are committed to advancing the interests of Texas counties and supporting the vital work they do for our communities."</p>

<p>Crownover's elevation comes after years of involvement with the statewide association. She joined the TAC Board of Directors in 2021 and previously served as president of the County Judges and Commissioners Association of Texas in 2023-24. Before entering public service, she operated her own business marketing and communications consulting company, with her involvement in youth sports and county parks ultimately sparking her interest in local government.</p>

<p>The Texas Association of Counties serves as the advocacy organization for all 254 Texas counties, with the Board of Directors including at least one official from each county office type. The board guides policy priorities and oversees the association's budget and programs affecting county operations statewide.</p>
