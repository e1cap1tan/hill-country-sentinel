            <p>Mayoral candidate Michael French demonstrated strong early campaign momentum by drawing 45 New Braunfels residents to his first town hall meeting, held at Cooper's Pit Bar-B-Que on Tuesday evening. The well-attended event provided French with a platform to outline his vision for the city and field questions from constituents ahead of the March primary election. French is one of five candidates competing for the mayor's office, with early voting beginning February 17.</p><p>The town hall format allowed French to engage directly with residents on key issues facing New Braunfels, including infrastructure development, water management, and maintaining the city's unique character amid rapid growth. Attendees posed questions about traffic congestion, utility rates, and the city's approach to new development projects. French's responses emphasized his commitment to balanced growth that preserves the community's small-town charm while accommodating necessary expansion.</p><p>"I was impressed by the turnout and the quality of questions," French said following the event. "It's clear that New Braunfels residents care deeply about their city's future, and I'm committed to being the kind of mayor who listens and responds to their concerns." The candidate's ability to draw nearly 50 residents to his first formal campaign event signals early organizational strength in what promises to be a competitive mayoral race.</p><p>The venue choice—Cooper's Pit Bar-B-Que—reflected French's strategy of hosting campaign events in locally-owned establishments that embody New Braunfels' community spirit. The setting fostered informal conversations and allowed for extended dialogue between French and attendees, many of whom stayed well past the formal conclusion of the event to continue discussions about city issues.</p><p>French's town hall is part of a broader trend toward grassroots campaigning in local New Braunfels politics, with candidates increasingly turning to Facebook groups and community events to reach voters directly. The mayor's race has attracted significant attention on local social media platforms, where residents actively discuss candidates' positions and share information about upcoming events.</p><p>With four other candidates in the mayoral race, French will need to maintain this early momentum through the primary campaign. The diverse field includes incumbents and newcomers with varying backgrounds in business, public service, and community leadership. Early voting begins February 17, giving French and his opponents just a few more weeks to make their cases to New Braunfels voters.</p><p>The success of French's first town hall suggests strong grassroots interest in the mayoral race and indicates that candidate forums and community events will play a crucial role in helping voters differentiate between the five candidates. As the campaign progresses, similar events hosted by other candidates are likely to draw comparable crowds of engaged residents.</p>
