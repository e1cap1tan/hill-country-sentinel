            <p>A proposed 150-unit, three-story hotel in downtown Gruene has ignited fierce community opposition, with residents raising concerns about water supply capacity and environmental impact during recent city council discussions.</p>

<p>The development, which would require clearing significant tree coverage to accommodate 150 parking spaces, has drawn criticism from local activists and residents who question whether the area's infrastructure can support such a large-scale project.</p>

<h2>Water Supply Concerns Central to Opposition</h2>

<p>At the heart of community concerns lies a fundamental question about water capacity. "We don't have the water for this," has become a rallying cry among opponents, reflecting broader regional concerns about sustainable development in the Texas Hill Country.</p>

<p>Local activist JoeyLynn Mesaros, who has built a substantial following of 30,000 on Instagram, attended recent city council meetings to voice opposition to the proposal. Her advocacy has helped amplify community concerns across social media platforms.</p>

<h2>Community Sentiment Strongly Opposed</h2>

<p>Social media discussions reveal widespread community opposition to the project. A post from Mesaros's Instagram account (@joeylynn_mesaros) from four weeks ago garnered 159 likes and sparked extensive discussion about the proposal's potential impacts on the historic Gruene area.</p>

<p>The Facebook group Concerned New Braunfels Residents Group (CNBRG) has also served as a hub for community discussion about the proposal, with residents sharing concerns about traffic, environmental impact, and the preservation of Gruene's historic character.</p>

<blockquote>"This isn't just about one hotel—it's about setting a precedent for what kind of development we want to see in our historic communities," wrote one Facebook commenter in the CNBRG discussion.</blockquote>

<h2>City Council Process Continues</h2>

<p>New Braunfels City Council meets on the second and fourth Mondays of each month at 6 p.m., providing ongoing opportunities for public input on the proposal. The formal review process for the hotel development is expected to continue through several future meetings.</p>

<p>City officials have not yet responded to requests for comment about the proposal's current status or timeline for final approval.</p>

<p>The debate reflects broader tensions throughout the Hill Country as historic communities grapple with growth pressures while trying to preserve their unique character and manage limited natural resources.</p>
