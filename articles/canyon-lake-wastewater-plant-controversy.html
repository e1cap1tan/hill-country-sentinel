            <p>Comal County residents are pressing the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to block a proposed wastewater treatment plant near Canyon Lake, citing environmental and development concerns.</p><p>The facility is part of permits for new development projects in the area, but residents argue it should not be evaluated in isolation.</p><p>During public comment periods, residents called for the agency to assess the plant cumulatively alongside permits for other developments and discharges in the region, rather than reviewing it as a standalone project.</p><p>Several speakers also called for a moratorium on new development in the area and throughout Comal County, reflecting growing concerns about rapid growth's impact on infrastructure and the environment.</p><p>As part of the TCEQ process, the agency will provide a written response to all public comments before making a decision on whether the application meets state legal requirements. That ruling will then be considered by the three TCEQ commissioners for final approval.</p><p>The controversy highlights ongoing tensions between development pressures and environmental protection in one of Texas's fastest-growing counties.</p>
