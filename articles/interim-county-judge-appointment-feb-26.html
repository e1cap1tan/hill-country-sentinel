            <p>Comal County Commissioners Court is expected to discuss appointing an interim county judge during their February 26 meeting, following the death of Judge Sherman Krause on February 7, 2026.</p><p>The appointment will be crucial for maintaining county operations, as the county judge serves as the chief administrative officer and presiding officer of the commissioners court.</p><p>While three Republican candidates are already on the March primary ballot for the full term - former Tax Assessor-Collector Kristen Hoyt, business owner Deb Hindman, and firefighter Kayne Parrish - the interim appointment would serve until the winner of that election takes office.</p><p>The commissioners court has the authority to appoint someone to fill the vacancy temporarily, ensuring continuity in county leadership during this transition period.</p><p>Judge Krause, who had served Comal County for years, chose not to file for re-election before his passing, making this vacancy particularly significant for the county's governance structure.</p>
