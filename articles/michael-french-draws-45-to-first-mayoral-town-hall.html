            <p>NEW BRAUNFELS, TX — Michael French, one of five candidates vying for the mayoral seat in New Braunfels, kicked off his campaign with a town hall event that drew 45 residents to Coopers Pit Bar-B-Que on Wednesday evening. The turnout, notable for an early campaign event, signals strong organizational efforts by French’s team as the race for mayor begins to heat up ahead of early voting on February 17.</p>

<p>French, a local business owner and longtime resident, used the town hall to outline his vision for the city, focusing on infrastructure improvements, economic development, and preserving New Braunfels’ small-town charm amid rapid growth. Attendees posed a range of questions, from traffic congestion on major corridors like FM 306 to concerns about rising property taxes. French emphasized a collaborative approach, promising to work closely with city council and community stakeholders if elected.</p>

<p>“I’m here to listen first and act second,” French told the crowd, as reported by attendees. “New Braunfels is at a crossroads, and we need leadership that prioritizes both progress and our heritage.” His remarks resonated with several residents, including longtime local Maria Hernandez, who said she appreciated his focus on balancing growth with affordability.</p>

<p>The mayoral race, which includes five candidates, is shaping up to be a competitive contest. Alongside French, the field features a mix of seasoned politicians and newcomers, each aiming to address the challenges of a city experiencing significant population growth and development pressures. Early voting begins on February 17, giving candidates a tight window to connect with voters before the March 3 election day. The winner will succeed Mayor Barron Casteel, who is not seeking re-election after two terms.</p>

<p>Local political observers note that French’s early turnout is a promising sign for his campaign, particularly in a crowded field. Drawing 45 residents to a midweek event suggests effective grassroots organizing, a critical factor in municipal elections where voter turnout is often low. “Getting people out this early shows he’s tapping into a network,” said Comal County political analyst Dr. Linda Torres. “But he’ll need to sustain that momentum.”</p>

<p>Adding to the dynamics of this election cycle, local Facebook groups have emerged as key platforms for political organizing and discussion. Pages like “New Braunfels Community Forum” and “Comal County Voters” are buzzing with posts about candidates, events, and city issues. French’s team has actively promoted the town hall through these channels, a strategy likely contributing to the event’s attendance. Other candidates are following suit, using social media to bypass traditional campaign methods in favor of direct voter engagement.</p>

<p>For residents, the town hall offered a first glimpse into French’s priorities and style as a candidate. While some left impressed by his preparedness, others, like retiree John Keller, remained undecided. “He’s got good ideas, but I want to hear from the others before I make up my mind,” Keller said. With several weeks of campaigning ahead, French and his opponents will have plenty of opportunities to sway voters in this pivotal election for New Braunfels.</p>
