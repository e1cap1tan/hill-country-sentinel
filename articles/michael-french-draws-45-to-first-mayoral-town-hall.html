            <p>Mayoral candidate Michael French drew an impressive crowd of 45 residents to his inaugural campaign town hall at Cooper's Pit Bar-B-Que, demonstrating strong early engagement in what promises to be a competitive race for New Braunfels mayor. The event showcased French's ability to organize and attract voters as the campaign season intensifies ahead of early voting, which begins February 17.</p>

<p>During the town hall, French fielded questions from attendees on a wide range of city issues, from infrastructure improvements and traffic management to economic development and quality of life concerns. The interactive format allowed residents to engage directly with the candidate, gaining insights into his platform and vision for New Braunfels' future.</p>

<p>The strong turnout reflects growing interest in the mayoral race, which features five candidates vying for the position. With early voting just days away, French's ability to draw nearly 50 people to his first major campaign event signals effective grassroots organizing and community engagement—key factors that could prove decisive in a multi-candidate field.</p>

<p>Local observers noted the significance of the venue choice and turnout size, particularly in an election cycle where candidates are working to distinguish themselves from a crowded field. The town hall format has become increasingly popular among local candidates as a way to demonstrate accessibility and responsiveness to voter concerns.</p>

<p>As the mayoral campaign progresses, French's early organizing success at Cooper's Pit Bar-B-Que establishes him as a serious contender capable of mobilizing community support. With four other candidates in the race and early voting imminent, the momentum generated by this initial town hall could prove crucial in building the coalition needed for electoral success.</p>

<p>The mayoral election will be held alongside other local contests, with early voting running from February 17 through February 28, followed by Election Day on March 3. Voters can find polling locations and additional information through the Comal County Elections Office website at www.co.comal.tx.us/Elections.htm.</p>
