            <p>Comal County commissioners are reviewing a proposed budget that would increase property tax rates by 3.2% to fund critical infrastructure projects including road improvements and emergency services expansion. The proposal comes as the county experiences rapid population growth requiring upgraded public services, but it would add to the tax burden already increased significantly in the current fiscal year.</p><p>Under the proposed budget, the county's tax rate would rise from the current 30.5 cents per  of assessed valuation—a rate that already represents a 15.4% increase from the previous year's no-new-revenue rate. For the average Comal County homeowner, the additional 3.2% increase would translate to approximately  in additional annual property taxes, according to county budget estimates.</p><p>The proposed funds would primarily support infrastructure improvements that county officials argue are essential for managing the area's explosive growth. Road maintenance and expansion projects would receive the largest allocation, followed by enhanced emergency services coverage for newly developed areas. County Judge candidates and commissioners have cited these infrastructure needs as among the most pressing challenges facing rapidly growing counties in the Texas Hill Country.</p><p>"We're trying to balance fiscal responsibility with the reality that our population growth demands increased services," said a county budget official speaking on background. "The question isn't whether these improvements are needed—it's whether we can afford not to make them." The county's population has grown by more than 25% over the past five years, straining existing infrastructure and services.</p><p>However, the proposed increase has drawn criticism from taxpayer advocacy groups and some county residents who argue that consecutive tax rate increases place an unfair burden on fixed-income homeowners and long-term residents. Property values in Comal County have also risen sharply, meaning homeowners face higher tax bills even without rate increases due to increased assessments.</p><p>The budget proposal includes provisions for several major capital projects, including upgrades to the county's emergency services facilities, expansion of courthouse operations, and improvements to rural road networks that serve growing residential developments. County officials argue these investments are necessary to maintain service levels as the population continues to expand.</p><p>Public hearings on the proposed budget are scheduled for later this month, giving residents an opportunity to voice their opinions before commissioners make a final decision. The budget must be adopted before the start of the new fiscal year, and any tax rate increase requires a formal vote by the Commissioners Court. County residents are encouraged to attend the public hearings to learn more about the proposed expenditures and provide input on the county's spending priorities.</p>
