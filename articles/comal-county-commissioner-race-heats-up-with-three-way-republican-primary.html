            <p>Three candidates have filed to compete for Comal County Commissioner Precinct 2 in the Republican primary election, setting up a competitive race that will determine the party's nominee for one of the most influential positions in county government. The contest features incumbent Sarah Martinez defending her seat against challenges from local business owner Tom Rodriguez and former school board member Jennifer Walsh.</p>

<p>Martinez, who is seeking her second term as Precinct 2 Commissioner, has made infrastructure improvements a central focus of her first term in office. Her administration has prioritized road maintenance and expansion projects throughout the precinct, responding to constituent concerns about traffic congestion and aging infrastructure. As the incumbent, Martinez brings the advantage of established relationships with county staff and contractors, as well as direct experience managing the complex budget and administrative responsibilities of the position.</p>

<p>Tom Rodriguez enters the race with extensive experience in the construction industry, operating a successful contracting business that has worked on numerous projects throughout Comal County. His private sector background provides him with intimate knowledge of local infrastructure challenges and the costs associated with addressing them. Rodriguez's campaign emphasizes fiscal responsibility and efficient project management, drawing on his business experience to propose solutions for the county's growing infrastructure needs.</p>

<p>Jennifer Walsh brings a different perspective to the race, having served multiple terms on the local school board where she focused on education policy and community engagement. Her experience in elected office, though at the school district level, demonstrates her ability to work collaboratively on complex issues and navigate the political dynamics inherent in public service. Walsh's campaign highlights her commitment to transparent government and responsive public service.</p>

<p>Key issues in the race include road maintenance and expansion, water infrastructure development, and managing the challenges associated with rapid population growth throughout Precinct 2. All three candidates acknowledge the strain that new development places on existing infrastructure and the need for proactive planning to address these challenges effectively.</p>

<p>The primary election is scheduled for March 5, 2026, with early voting beginning February 14. The winner of the Republican primary will face any Democratic opposition in the November general election, though the position has traditionally been decided in the GOP primary given the county's political makeup.</p>

<p>Voters in Precinct 2 can expect increased campaign activity in the coming weeks as all three candidates work to differentiate themselves and build coalitions of support. The race represents an important opportunity for residents to influence the direction of local government and infrastructure policy for the next four years.</p>
