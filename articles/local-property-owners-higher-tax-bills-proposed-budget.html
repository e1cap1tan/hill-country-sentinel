            <p>Comal County commissioners are reviewing a proposed budget that would increase property tax rates by 3.2% to fund critical infrastructure projects including road improvements and emergency services expansion. The current tax rate of 30.5 cents per  valuation was increased 15.4% in 2026 from the previous no-new-revenue rate. The proposal comes as the county experiences rapid population growth requiring upgraded public services.</p>
