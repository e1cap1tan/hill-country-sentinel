# Content Pipeline Instructions for Articles and External Content

## Critical Rule: sourceUrl Must Be RELATIVE for Internal Articles

**For original Hill Country Sentinel articles, sourceUrl MUST be a relative path:**
- ✅ `articles/my-article-slug.html`
- ❌ `https://e1cap1tan.github.io/hill-country-sentinel/articles/my-article-slug.html`
- ❌ `https://e1cap1tan.github.io/comal-gop-watch/articles/my-article-slug.html`

**NEVER use absolute URLs for internal articles.** The site uses relative paths for GitHub Pages compatibility. Absolute URLs will break navigation.

## Critical Rule: Always Use Specific Article URLs for External Sources

**NEVER use generic homepage URLs for external articles.** Always find the specific article URL.

❌ **Wrong**: `https://herald-zeitung.com`
❌ **Wrong**: `https://texastribune.org`
❌ **Wrong**: `https://co.comal.tx.us`

✅ **Correct**: `https://herald-zeitung.com/news/specific-article-title/article_123abc.html`
✅ **Correct**: `https://texastribune.org/2026/02/10/texas-politics-article/`
✅ **Correct**: `https://co.comal.tx.us/page/commissioners-court/meeting-minutes-02-10-26`

## External Article Archival Workflow

For ALL external articles (not source "Hill Country Sentinel"):

1. **Find the specific article URL** - Never use homepage URLs
2. **Add the feed entry** with the specific `sourceUrl`
3. **Create archive backup** using the archive script:
   ```bash
   # Use the archival system to create local backup
   node scripts/archive-article.js \
     --url "https://specific-article-url.com/path" \
     --slug "descriptive-slug-matching-feed-id" \
     --source "Publication Name"
   ```
4. **Update feed entry** to include `archiveUrl` field pointing to the archive

Example feed entry with archive:
```json
{
  "id": "cn-001",
  "date": "2026-02-10T12:00:00",
  "title": "County Judge Seat Vacant After Passing of Sherman Krause",
  "summary": "...",
  "source": "Herald-Zeitung",
  "sourceUrl": "https://herald-zeitung.com/news/county-judge-sherman-krause-passes/article_abc123.html",
  "archiveUrl": "articles/archive/county-judge-seat-vacant.html",
  "category": "county-government",
  "tags": ["county-judge", "vacancy"]
}
```

## When to Create Original Articles

Create original articles using the `generate-article.js` script when:

- **Press releases and official announcements**: When the source is a press release, official government announcement, board minutes, chamber of commerce release, or association announcement (not journalism)
- **Social media only sources**: The story originates from Facebook community groups, Nextdoor, local social media discussions with no corresponding news article
- **Community discussion**: Local debates or conversations happening without formal news coverage
- **Direct observation**: Events, meetings, or situations observed but not covered by traditional media
- **Multiple fragmented sources**: When a story exists across multiple social posts, community discussions, or informal sources that need to be synthesized

### Press Release Rule

**If the source is a press release or official announcement (not journalism), create an original article:**

- Write an original journalistic article that reports on the press release content in a journalistic style (not just copy it)
- The article should include who/what/when/where/why and local context
- Always include a footnote/source section at the bottom linking to the original press release
- Feed card should link to OUR article, not the press release
- Source in feed entry should be "Hill Country Sentinel"
- Include the original press release link in the `sources` parameter when generating the article

## Research Process

Before writing an original article, thoroughly research to gather:

1. **Business/Location Details**:
   - Exact business name and address
   - Historic district or neighborhood context
   - Business type and background

2. **Timeline**:
   - When the incident/discussion began
   - Key dates and developments
   - Current status

3. **Community Response**:
   - Representative quotes from community discussion
   - Range of perspectives (support, opposition, neutral)
   - Volume and nature of response

4. **Factual Context**:
   - Relevant local ordinances or policies
   - Similar incidents in the area
   - Background on the broader issue

## Article Creation Workflow

1. **Write the Article**: Draft journalistic content with:
   - Objective, factual tone
   - Clear headline and lead paragraph
   - Quotes from community discussion (anonymized if needed)
   - Balanced perspective showing multiple viewpoints
   - Local context and background

2. **Generate Article File**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-article.js \
     --slug "descriptive-slug" \
     --title "Clear, Factual Headline" \
     --date "YYYY-MM-DD" \
     --body "<p>Article HTML content...</p>" \
     --tags "relevant,tags,for,filtering" \
     --sources "Facebook Community Group,Local Reports,Community Discussion"
   ```
   
   **Note**: The article generator automatically creates a professional header image using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash. See Image Style Rules below for the mandatory style prompt.

3. **Create Feed Entry**: Add entry to the appropriate feed JSON file with:
   - `source`: "Hill Country Sentinel" (not "Facebook" or "Social Media")
   - `sourceUrl`: The generated article path (e.g., `articles/article-slug.html`)
   - `image`: Path to the generated header image (e.g., `articles/images/article-slug.jpg`)
   - Appropriate category and tags

## Mandatory Header Images

**All articles must have header images.** This includes:

- **New articles**: Automatically generated during article creation via `generate-article.js`
- **Existing articles**: Use the Gemini image generation tool manually if needed:
  ```bash
  cd tools/gemini-image
  ./generate.sh "PROMPT with style suffix" articles/images/article-slug.png
  ```

- **Feed entries**: Include `image` field pointing to header image path

### Image Style Rules (CRITICAL)

**Two distinct visual systems:**
1. **Site chrome** (header, nav, footer, branding): Woodcut/ink illustration style, sepia/navy/red palette
2. **Article header images**: **Soft watercolor wash** — generated with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (`gemini-2.5-flash-image`)

### Mandatory Image Style Suffix (UPDATED Feb 16, 2026)

**Append this exact style suffix to EVERY article image prompt:**

```
A wide panoramic scene (16:9 aspect ratio, landscape orientation). Soft watercolor painting style. Warm washes of sepia, muted gold, and dusty blue. Loose, impressionistic brushwork with visible paper texture and color bleeds. The edges of the painting gradually fade to pure white, with soft watercolor washes dissolving seamlessly into a clean white background on all sides. No hard borders, frames, or sharp edges.
```

### Image Generation Tool

```bash
cd tools/gemini-image
./generate.sh "[Scene description]. Soft watercolor painting style. Warm washes of sepia, muted gold, and dusty blue. Loose, impressionistic brushwork with visible paper texture and color bleeds. The edges of the painting gradually fade to pure white, with soft watercolor washes dissolving seamlessly into a clean white background on all sides. No hard borders, frames, or sharp edges." output-path.png
```

### Image Content Rules (UPDATED Feb 16, 2026)

**For watercolor/paint-style images (all article headers):**
- ✅ CAN depict real people based on their likeness
- ✅ CAN depict real places, landmarks, and buildings
- ✅ CAN include signage with real names
- ✅ Edges MUST fade to pure white (#FFFFFF) — seamless blend with page background

**For photorealistic images (NOT used for articles, but rule exists):**
- ❌ Do NOT depict real people, real businesses, or real locations in photorealistic style

**Example prompts (scene description only — always append the style suffix above):**
- Town hall meeting: "A heated community meeting inside a rustic Texas limestone courthouse, citizens at wooden benches facing a raised panel"
- Wastewater concerns: "A Texas Hill Country river winding through green landscape with rolling hills and scattered live oak trees"
- Mayoral race: "A small Texas town square with a historic courthouse, American flags, and campaign signs"

## Content Standards

### Article Body HTML Format:
- Use `<p>` tags for paragraphs
- Use `<blockquote>` for community quotes or social media excerpts
- Use `<h2>` and `<h3>` for section headings
- Keep HTML clean and semantic

### Tone and Style:
- **Factual and objective**: Present information without editorial commentary
- **Local focus**: Emphasize Comal County context and relevance
- **Balanced**: Include multiple perspectives when available
- **Respectful**: Avoid inflammatory language while reporting facts

### Source Attribution:
- Cite "Community Discussion" for general social media response
- Use "Local Reports" for information gathered from multiple informal sources
- Specific source names only when they are public and relevant

## Example Article Structure:

```html
<p>A retail establishment in Gruene Historic District has drawn community attention after displaying a pride flag, sparking discussion among local residents about businesses taking social positions.</p>

<p>The Gruene Historic Market, located at 1234 Hunter Road in the historic shopping district, began displaying the rainbow flag earlier this week, according to community reports.</p>

<blockquote>"I just think businesses should focus on serving customers, not making political statements," said one commenter on a local Facebook group discussing the display.</blockquote>

<p>The response has been mixed, with some residents expressing support for the business's right to display the flag, while others questioned whether such displays are appropriate in the historic district.</p>

<h2>Community Response</h2>

<p>The discussion has taken place primarily on social media platforms, with residents debating the role of businesses in social issues...</p>
```

## Take Action Resources Section (MANDATORY)

Every original article MUST include a "Take Action" section before the footer. This gives voters actionable resources related to the article content.

### HTML Format:
```html
<section class="take-action">
    <h3>Take Action</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="resource-web"></span><span class="resource-label">Website:</span> <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Example Agency</a></li>
        <li><span class="resource-phone"></span><span class="resource-label">Phone:</span> <a href="tel:+18305551234">(830) 555-1234</a></li>
        <li><span class="resource-email"></span><span class="resource-label">Email:</span> <a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a></li>
        <li><span class="resource-address"></span><span class="resource-label">Address:</span> 150 N Seguin Ave, New Braunfels, TX 78130</li>
        <li><span class="resource-date"></span><span class="resource-label">Next Meeting:</span> March 3, 2026 at 9:00 AM</li>
    </ul>
</section>
```

### What to include (research and verify):
- Government office websites, phone numbers, email addresses
- Public comment/feedback forms
- Meeting dates and locations
- Voter registration links
- Relevant elected officials' contact info
- Filing deadlines, early voting dates
- Any URL that helps voters act on the information

### Resource types (CSS classes):
- `resource-web` — website links
- `resource-phone` — phone numbers (use `tel:` links)
- `resource-email` — email addresses (use `mailto:` links)
- `resource-address` — physical addresses
