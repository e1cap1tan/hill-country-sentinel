    "summary": "The May 2, 2026 New Braunfels General Election will be a candidate-only ballot — no bond measures, charter amendments, or ballot propositions are scheduled for local voters this cycle. City Council officially ordered the election on February 9, featuring three contested races: Mayor (Neal Linnartz, Michael French, Angela Allen, Jonathon Frazier, and Bradley Porter), City Council District 5 (Mary Ann Labowski), and City Council District 6 (April Ryan with challengers Nikki Shaw and Steven Voges). The city's last bond election was May 2023, when voters approved $140 million across three propositions for parks, streets, and libraries with no projected tax rate increase. New Braunfels ISD last held a bond election in May 2024. No charter amendments were submitted to the city secretary before the February deadline for this cycle. Comal County also has no ballot measures on the May 2 date. Early voting runs April 20–28; voter registration deadline is April 2.
